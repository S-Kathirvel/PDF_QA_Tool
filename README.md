## **A PDF Question Answering model using RAG Architecture using [LlamaIndexðŸ¦™](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/)**

##**RAG Architecture**:
              The model incorporates Retrieval Augumented Generation Arrchitecture which allows the LLM to respond the to the prompt from the provided context. Generally speaking the LLMs respond to the queries from the training data it was trained with, using RAG architecture we make use of the ability of the llm that generates text with the content Retrived from the documents we provide to the model
